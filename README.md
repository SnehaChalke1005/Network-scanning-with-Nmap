# Network-scanning-with-Nmap

#Description
This project demonstrates how to use Nmap for basic network scanning and security auditing. It covers host discovery, port scanning, service detection, and operating system fingerprinting. The goal is to understand how attackers and administrators identify open ports and services in a network, and how this information can be used to improve security.

#Features
Host Discovery – Identify live systems on a network.
Port Scanning – Detect open TCP/UDP ports.
Service Detection – Find out which services and versions are running.
OS Fingerprinting – Guess the operating system of the target machine.
Firewall Detection – Check if packet filters or firewalls are present.
Subnet Scanning – Scan multiple hosts or entire subnets


#Goal
To gain hands‑on experience with network security basics.
To understand how open ports and services can expose vulnerabilities.
To build confidence in using Linux commands and security tools
